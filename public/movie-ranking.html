<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
    What I liked about this movie is the message for the Engineering students that,
    Even though life brings obstacles to you never get scared, be determined to acheive
    your goals. Life is not a race, it is a learning journey.
    Don't compare your marks/grades, they are not everything in real life.
    It is not important to remember the topics word to word, but to understand the concepts
    and meaning of those topics. And this is learning, real life learning.

<h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Dewaani</h3>
<p>
    This movie is about a photographer, traveller Bunny who lives away from his home India,
    alone without his parents and friends. He is running away from responsibilities, roming
    around the world living his life. Taking perfect shots all over the world.
    He doesn't care about his family, even he do not visit India on his father's Funeral.
    But, he comes back to India on his friend Aditi's wedding invitation. He falls in love with
    Naina, one of his scholar friend, which never lets him go on the world hunt again.
    And he understands the meaning of spending time with his own people, responsibilities and so on.
    With the Happy Ending on the New Year's eve he proposes Naina to be his wifey.

<h3>Deul Band</h3>
<p>
    This movie is about spirituality. It is about the ideals of Shree Swami Samartha Maharaj.
    The story is about an aethist scientist who is Indo-American, who comes to India.
    He comes to India his home country, for a project to increase the Indian ocean frequency to
    stop terrorist attacks and Bomb blasts in India.
    With his hatred about the existence of energy of Swami Maharaj, he is made to revolve around
    various places, just to crack his password. In that journey, he learns about various things,
    his misconceptions about his father's death and learns about the existence of Swami Maharaj.
    It is about believing in God, afterall he is the reason for everything that happens in the world.
